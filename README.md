# Comp Science Project
My Internal Computer Science Project!

Was orginally required to be written in python but wanted a frontend web design as e621 so ig I did both python (backend) and javascript (frontend).

# Usages
Run the following command for first time usages
### npm install
### pip install [Lib Name for python later :P]

Usages:
* npm run start - development server for react app
* npm run test - I will skip the unit testing because the frontend isn't that complicated...
* npm run build - build a static frontend
* npm run prodstart - Run the production server (building the frontend is required)
