# Comp Science Project
My Internal Computer Science Project!

Was orginally required to be written in python but wanted a frontend web design as e621 so ig I did both python (backend) and javascript (frontend).

# Prerequisite
You do need both GOOGLE_API and GOOGLE_CX values that are set via environment variable before you can use the backend.
* GOOGLE_API = Get the key inside google cloud's api management somewhere
* GOOGLE_CX = https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new

# Usages
Run the following command on a new setup
* `npm install`
* `pip install Flask requests`

Usages:
* `npm run start` - development server for react app
* `npm run test` - I will skip the unit testing because the frontend isn't that complicated...
* `npm run build` - build a static frontend
* `npm run prodstart` - Run the production server (building the frontend is required)
